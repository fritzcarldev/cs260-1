# Mongo Examples

I created several files to demonstrate different things about Mongo.

- **bnb.js** - Smaller version of this really good [tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/quickstart/node-crud-tutorial/) created by MongoDB
- **mongoose.js** - Rewrite of Quiz mongoose question.
- **newquiz.js** - Rewrite of Quiz Mongo question.
- **simple.js** - Minimal Mongo demonstration.
- **template.js** - Minimal Mongo template using async/await.
- **quiz.js** - The origianl Quiz question in all of its `setTimeout` glory. The problem here is that it doesn't use async/await.
