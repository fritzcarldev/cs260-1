# vue-cli-demo

This is a very simple Vue application build with the Vue CLI. It has one component `CenteredDiv` that displays its content centered within a div. There is also a click handler that toggles the style of component from the vue instance.

## Basic project actions

```
npm install
npm run serve
npm run build
```
